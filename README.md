Version History

A) V0.4 The game runs again and is slightly more efficient in displaying the images on the screen. It still isn't exactly a game yet since the ball lacks collision detection. The code should be more readable and more logically organized. Player input to move the paddle has been added.

B) V0.3 Major reworking of all the classes. In terms of running and displaying images it has taken a small step backwards, since the game doesn't run anymore. However, the changes that have been made will make for a much smoother running game in the end and code that is much easier to read. The paddle, ball, and blocks all have their own classes now with most of the methods written and theoretically operational. I've also made the program multi-threaded with GUI and the GameLoop separated.

C) V0.2 The "Game" now loads the graphics for the blocks, ball, and paddle as well. It isn't much of a game yet since nothing moves and there is no player input. That will come in the next update.

D) V0.1 The "Game" opens and displays the background image and that is it right now.
