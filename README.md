Version History

A) V0.2 The "Game" now loads the graphics for the blocks, ball, and paddle as well. It isn't much of a game yet since nothing moves and there is no player input. That will come in the next update.

B) V0.1 The "Game" opens and displays the background image and that is it right now.
